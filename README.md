# 3D Vision Test: Implement NERF from scratch (100 points)
Goals:  In this assigment, you will implement the NERF model from scratch base on the paper [NERF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934)

## 0. Setup
Packages that you will need can be installed using the 'requirements.txt' file (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).

## 1. Assingments

### 1.1 Render (30 pts)
Read the paper about the rendering technique and complete the TODO code

### 1.2 Model (30 pts)
Read the paper about the model architecture and complete the TODO code

### 1.3 Optimize (40 pts)
Run the test.py to test model. Optimize the model to have the best results. 

## 2. Report
After doing the implementation of NERF, report your results in a .pdf file.
